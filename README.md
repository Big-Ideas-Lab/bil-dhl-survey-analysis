## BIG Ideas Lab's Duke Health Listens Survey Study

Big Ideas Lab at Duke (https://dunn.pratt.duke.edu/) conducted an electronic survey of participants from an online patient advisory group of Duke University Health System around smart device ownership, usage, and data sharing.


### Background: 
Smart portable devices- smartphones and smartwatches- are rapidly being adopted by the general population, which has brought forward an opportunity to use the large volumes of physiological, behavioral, and activity data continuously being collected by these devices in naturalistic settings to perform research, monitor health, and track disease. While these data can serve to revolutionize health monitoring in research and clinical care, minimal research has been conducted to understand what motivates people to use these devices and their interest and comfort in sharing the data.

### Objective: 
To characterize the ownership and usage of smart devices among patients from an expansive academic health system in the southeastern US and understand their willingness to share data collected by the smart devices.

### Methods: 
We conducted an electronic survey of participants from an online patient advisory group around smart device ownership, usage, and data sharing. 

### Results: 
Out of the 3,021 members of the online patient advisory group, 1,368 (45%) responded to the survey, with 871 female (64%), 826 and 390 White (60%) and Black (29%) participants, respectively, and a slight majority (52%) age 58 and older. Most of the respondents (98%) owned a smartphone and the majority (59%) owned a wearable. In this population, people who identify as female, Hispanic, and Generation Z (age 18-25), and those completing higher education and having full-time employment, were most likely to own a wearable device compared to their demographic counterparts. 50% of smart device owners were willing to share and 32% would consider sharing their smart device data for research purposes. The type of activity data they are willing to share varies by gender, age, education, and employment.

### Significance: 
Findings from this study can be used to design both equitable and cost-effective digital health studies, leveraging personally-owned smartphones and wearables in representative populations, ultimately enabling the development of equitable digital health technologies.
